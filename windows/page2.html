            DOMESTIC WINDOW CLEANING Our Residential or Domestic Window Cleaners
            will have your house or apartment windows shining in a short time!
            It is often only after your windows are cleaned that you notice how
            dirty they were. You will enjoy the view and added sense of space,
            and it will give your home a nice and fresh look. It makes sense
            because windows let light in which illuminates the entire house!

            STRATA WINDOW CLEANING Strata Managers or representatives can
            contact us to discuss their needs and we will offer the options
            available on how to best handle cleaning all the common area and
            difficult access windows in the block. Access to the windows is most
            economical when individual apartments can be reached from inside.
            This offers a more personal service and the tenants can choose to
            individually have the rest of their windows cleaned at the same
            time. We can also use waterfed poles externally for windows up to
            three floors high.

            And we are also experienced, qualified, licensed and insured to use
            a Cherry Picker, which is perfect for strata blocks of apartments of
            up to five storeys high. An advantage of using these Elevating Work
            Platforms is that we get up close to every window and will deliver
            an excellent clean, the same quality as if your windows were on the
            ground floor.

            REAL ESTATE WINDOW CLEANING Real Estate Agents can easily arrange to
            have our Window Cleaning service at end of tenancy, which will set
            the standard which the incoming tenant will need to reach when they
            eventually vacate house or apartment. Sparkling windows enhance a
            property and its surrounding views, and will undoubtedly help sell
            properties on the market.
