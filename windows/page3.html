        <p>
          WHY SHOULD I CLEAN MY WINDOWS REGULARLY? In residential spaces the
          external window surfaces usually start to look dirty about ten weeks
          after the last clean. The interior glass surfaces build up the residue
          of various smells and the mist from human breathing continually also,
          and this residue remains there although it can take about four months
          to begin to be visible as well. In commercial spaces used by staff or
          customers, or in busy locations, the glass usually looks dirty on the
          exterior and has an internal film of dirt in less than a month since
          the last clean. You can reduce health risks by regular thorough window
          cleaning, which will remove dirt particles and germs that can
          otherwise just keep building up on your exterior and interior glass
          surfaces and can become airborne again. It is not only removable dirt
          that can build up on your windows. There are also other dirt build ups
          which can leave permanent stains on your windows, sometimes from old
          metal fly-screens, which should be replaced with fibreglass ones to
          prevent this build-up.
        </p>
        <p>
          CAN YOU ALSO CLEAN FLY SCREENS, WINDOW SILLS, WINDOW FRAMES AND
          MIRRORS? Yes. Window cleaning essentially includes only the glass part
          of the windows or sliding doors. But we will happily add on any of
          these related items to our service and to our quote. We can clean your
          fly screens, window sills, window frames, bedroom and bathroom
          mirrors, and most shower screens and accessiible metal shutters. We
          are also associated with domestic cleaners and post construction
          cleaners if you would like the rest of your cleaning done
          professionally too.
        </p>

        <p>
          HOW OFTEN SHOULD WINDOWS BE CLEANED? Commercial premises like Cafes,
          Restaurants and Gyms usually need a full window cleaning service done
          once per month. To get that pleasant clean feeling in your home, in
          most locations windows generally need to be cleaned every three
          months. Cleaning your windows at three month intervals means that they
          will look clean almost all the time. They usually start to look dirty
          after about 8 or ten weeks. In some locations it is enough to clean
          your windows every six months and they will look clean most of the
          time. However, if it is important to you yo have a cleaner and more
          germ-free environment, I recommend getting your home windows cleaned
          once every three months.
        </p>

        <p>
          WHAT HAPPENS IF I DON"T MAINTAIN MY HOME WINDOWS CLEAN AT LEAST EVERY
          THREE OR SIX MONTHS? If windows are left without cleaning maintenance
          for longer than six months, they will definitely be showing dirt on
          both the inside and the outside. The dirt that collects and
          accumulates on windows comes from many sources, and it can make the
          air in your home unhygienic and not pure. It can come from dust, car
          tyre particles, humidity, breathing and mould. Grease and steam from
          cooking internally and barbecues externally also make your windows
          look unclean. Additionally, there are other airborne particles that
          can land on windows, such as smoking or pet smells, paint, insect
          sprays and various other chemicals which may be in use nearby or at
          your property. Some plants, insects and birds can also cause the
          exterior of your home to look very unsightly as well, if your cobwebs
          are not removed or if your glass is not cleaned regularly.
        </p>
        <p>
          APART FROM LOOKING DIRTY, CAN ANYTHING BAD HAPPEN TO ME OR MY HOME
          WINDOWS IF I WASH THEM ONLY ONCE PER YEAR OR EVEN LESS FREQUENTLY THAN
          THAT? Yes. Direct contact with dirt built up on glass and also
          breathing the air in the room, can carry these particles which can
          include germs, through your skin and your lungs. Also, the air is not
          as nice to breathe in a room that has unclean glass. Even if the
          gradual build-up was not noticeable, once the windows are clean you
          can feel and smell the improvement in the air quality. The worst of
          these dirt accumulations as far as durability of glass goes, is the
          build-up of various minerals. These are usually from building
          materials above the glass, sometimes from a runoff from a higher
          surface like a roof, gutter or drain, from water stained by old metal
          fly screens. The least regularly you clean, the more the dirt builds
          up, and the higher the risk of permanent stains appearing on glass
          panels and their surrounding surfaces.
        </p>
        <p>
          CAN RAIN WATER OR TAP WATER CAUSE PERMANENT MINERAL STAINS ON WINDOWS?
          Yes. A usually unsuspected source of this problem is the mineral
          buildup that will eventually result from normal water drying on your
          windows. This can be from rain water, and surprisingly also from
          repeatedly using a garden hose to remove surface dirt from your
          windows. Without regular professional window cleaning, ideally every
          three months or at least every six months, the result can be
          permanently stained glass which can only be made to look new again by
          replacing it. Sometimes this mineral buil-up can be removed from glass
          through a special cleaning mineral removal service we can provide as a
          separate job.
        </p>
        <p>
          CAN WINDOW FRAMES AND PAINTWORK AROUND WINDOWS GET DAMAGED IF NOT
          CLEANED? The excretions of some plants, insects and birds, can be
          corrosive to the metal and painted frames and surfaces around your
          windows, if left there for a long period. This can result in your
          window frames having permanent stains which cannot be cleaned off
          anymore, and which could only be improved by repainting or replacing.
        </p>

        <p>
          WHAT IS THE BEST WAY TO PREVENT ALL THESE PROBLEMS AND BRIGHTEN UP
          YOUR HOME? All of the normal dirt and almost all of the potentially
          permanently damaging or staining substances, can be cleaned off
          completely if the domestic window cleaning is done regularly at about
          three month intervals, or at the very least every six months. At
          either of these frequencies, your windows at home will look clean most
          of the time.
